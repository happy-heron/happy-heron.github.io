## STEM Camp Overview

In its inaugural Summer STEM Camp, North Caroline High School students (aka “STEM LEADERs), mentored Ridgely Elementary School students (aka “munchkins”).

The munchkins participated in a week of really awesome activities (building a solar powered car, for example!) while creating strong bonds with their STEM LEADERs who were led by SENIOR STEM LEADER Ashlynn Bisesi. The munchkins arrived each morning looking for their "favorite" mentor. 

Throughout the week, our STEM LEADERs emerged from their shells - developing into confident individuals. Our Curriculum Chair, Israel, was quiet and nervous on day 1 as he was explaining the lessons and activities to the munchkins. Each day his confidence grew until he was taking charge without hesitation. 

This was truly an amazing experience for everyone involved in our first Summer STEM Camp which served as a “leadership laboratory” for the high school students who planned and delivered an engaging science and technology program for their elementary school participants.

Media Chair Ayden Russell’s team has posted tons of awesome pictures from each STEM Camp day.

Over the course of four engaging and educational days, students participated in a variety of hands-on STEM activities designed to foster curiosity and critical thinking about science, technology, engineering, and the environment.

**Day 1** began with an accountability lesson to promote responsibility and teamwork, followed by a static friction activity that introduced students to the forces that resist motion. The day concluded with the start of a lesson on conductors and insulators, using aluminum foil to explore how materials interact with electricity.

**Day 2** continued the exploration of electricity with an energy stick activity, where students learned how the human body can act as a conductor to complete a circuit. This was followed by further experiments with conductors and insulators, and wrapped up with engaging STEM-related activities.

**Day 3** featured special visits from Choptank Electric and Choptank Fiber. Students learned how electricity travels through power lines and how fiber optics transmit internet signals. The day ended with an engineering challenge—building a fan-powered car, combining creativity with problem-solving skills.

**Day 4** focused on environmental science, starting with a lesson on renewable vs. non-renewable resources. Students participated in activities comparing these energy sources, then dissected a cookie in a simulation of coal mining, illustrating the environmental damage caused by extracting and burning fossil fuels. The day concluded with students constructing their own solar-powered cars, applying what they learned about clean energy.

Throughout the camp, students explored real-world applications of science and engineering, developing a deeper understanding of how technology impacts both society and the environment.
