The Bay 100 STEM Camp is back after a three-year hiatus with the mission to teach elementary-aged students (aka munchkins) STEM through hands-on experiments and demonstrations. Have you ever wondered how an engine works? Or how a radio picks up sound? Starting in 2026, munchkins in St. Michaels and Tilghman will explore a range of activities related to the camp theme of “Technology and Teamwork.” These activities include assembling a model diesel engine, learning how to use a ham radio, and building mobile robots. Throughout these lessons, the munchkins will gain an understanding of the technology that surrounds us and develop fundamental teamwork skills. They will work together to engineer a device to protect an egg from a high drop and test the limits of walkie-talkies. Overall, they will have fun as they learn about technology in hands-on demonstrations. 
A group of high school STEM Leaders will inspire intellectual curiosity by leading hands-on demonstrations and lessons. They are working with the YMCA and Talbot County Public Schools to support the camp behind the scenes. The Bay 100 STEM Camp is a branch of the MidShore Summer STEM Camp, which empowers high school students to teach STEM to elementary-aged kids. We are excited to welcome munchkins to the Bay 100 STEM Camp. See you in the summer of 2026!

Below are some kits we will use to teach the kids about technology!
