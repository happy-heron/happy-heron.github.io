- Commit your changes when ready
- Changes will propagate after about 2 minutes, at a maximum
## Images
- Upload the image into the `/static/img/` directory
- Reference it in the "images" array near the top of the page
- When using it in the post, the syntax is:
`![IMAGE_TITLE](/img/IMAGE_NAME_GOES_HERE.jpg)`
N.B. The image title won't be shown on the post, unless hovered over
## Making blog posts
- They are in the `/content/posts/` directory
- Follow the syntax of the first post (`first-post.md`)
